Quick Steps
===========

NOTE: THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE, USE IT FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO UPDATE AN OLDER VERSION OF THE SERVER TO THIS VERSION
AND IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO UPDATE THIS VERSION TO A NEWER ONE
IN THE FUTURE.

1. Unpack the entire WebIssues Server package to the web server's document
   root directory.

2. Create a database and a user account with sufficient privileges to create
   tables in that database.

3. Make sure that the data/ subdirectory is writable for the web server.

4. Point your browser to the admin/setup/install.php page and follow
   the instructions.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the data/ and common/data/ directories are
not accessible to unauthorized users. You can use the accompanying .htaccess
files or configure your web server manually to forbid access to these
directories.
