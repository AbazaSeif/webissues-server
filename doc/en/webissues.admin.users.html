          <p>Managing users in the WebIssues system includes the creation of user accounts, managing global rights of users, and giving users access to specific projects.</p>

            <p>To manage the users of WebIssues system, go to the Administration Panel and click <span class="guilabel">User Accounts</span>. In case of the Desktop Client, use the <span class="guilabel">Users</span> command from the main window toolbar.</p>
            <div class="figure">
              <a id="id601132"></a>
              <div class="figure-contents">

            </div>
            <p>Each user has a unique, fixed login, which is used along with the password when logging into the system. Each user also has a name that is visible to other users and that can be changed by the administrator if necessary. Depending on the convention, it can be the first and last name, the email address, or any other name.</p>
            <p>Managing privileges in the WebIssues system is relatively simple. There are three global access levels:</p>
            <div class="variablelist">
              <dl>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">System administrator</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Users with this level have access to all functions of the Administration Panel. They can manage user accounts and customize the issue types and public views. They are also members and administrators of all existing projects in the system, even if they are not explicitly granted such permissions. The first such account is created upon installation.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Regular user</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Users with this level of access can log into the system and change their personal settings. They can access only those projects to which they were granted specific privileges. They can be administrators of selected projects, but they can't create new projects.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Disabled</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Users with this level of access are not allowed to log into the system and do not have access to any part of it.</p>
                </dd>
              </dl>
            </div>
            <p>To create a new user account, select <span class="guilabel">Add User</span>.</p>
            <div class="figure">
              <a id="id601212"></a>
              <div class="figure-contents">

            </div>
            <p>Enter the name of the user, the login and initial password. To avoid mistakes, you must enter the password twice. You can select <span class="guilabel">User must change password at next logon</span> to force the user to change password when logging into the system for the first time.</p>
            <p>If the user doesn't remember their password, you can reset it by selecting the user from the list and clicking <span class="guilabel">Change Password</span>. You will be asked to enter a new password twice. Also in this case you can select <span class="guilabel">User must change password at next logon</span>.</p>

            </div>
            <p>When you're changing your own password, for greater security you must also enter your current password. All users can also change their own password at any time, using the <span class="guilabel">Change Password</span> command, which is available in the <span class="guilabel">Tools</span> window or in the toolbar of the Desktop Client main window.</p>
            <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
              <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
              <p>If you forget the system administrator's password, you cann't easily recover it. All passwords are stored in a database as secure hashes, and it's practically impossible to recreate the original password. However, if you have  access to the database, you can reset the administrator's password, by generating a new hash and storing it in the <code class="literal">user_passwd</code> column for the corresponding user in the <code class="literal">users</code> table. WebIssues uses the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Portable PHP password hashing framework</span>”</span>, which is compatible with such programs as Wordpress or Drupal, so you can use one of the available <a class="ulink" href="http://scriptserver.mainframe8.com/wordpress_password_hasher.php" target="_top">hash generators</a> for these programs.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To change the global access level of a user, select that user on the list and click <span class="guilabel">Change Access</span>. Then choose the new access level and click <span class="guibutton">OK</span>. You can't deprive your own administrator right, because the system must have at least one active administrator account.</p>

              <p>Avoid changing the names of users who have assigned issues. Attribute values ​​are stored as text, so changing the user name will not automatically change the values ​​of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Assigned to</span>”</span> attributes. This may cause the user to no longer see those assigned issues.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To manage the list of projects available for the selected user, use the <span class="guilabel">User Projects</span> command. You can also manage the list of users who have access to the selected project. For more information, please refer to <a class="xref" href="webissues.admin.users.html#webissues.admin.users.members" title="Project members">the section called “Project members”</a>.</p>
            <p>You can also change the preferences of any user using the <span class="guilabel">User Preferences</span> command. All users can also change their own settings, using the <span class="guilabel">User Prererences</span> command in the <span class="guilabel">Tools</span> window or in the toolbar of the Desktop Client main window. For more information about user preferences, see <a class="xref" href="webissues.work.personal.html" title="Personalization">the section called “Personalization”</a>.</p>
            <p>The WebIssues system does not allow to delete existing users, because it keeps all the historical information; for example, changes made by individual users. Instead, you can change the access level of users to disabled, when they should no longer be able to use the system. Use the filtering options in the upper right corner of the list to hide disabled user accounts.</p>
            <p>The WebIssues system allows users to register new accounts by themselves. In this case it is necessary for the system administrator to the approve registration requests. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="webissues.admin.register.html" title="Registration requests">the section called “Registration requests”</a> and <a class="xref" href="webissues.custom.settings.html" title="Advanced settings">the section called “Advanced settings”</a>.</p>

            <p>A newly created user has no access to any project, unless he is the system administrator. To manage user privileges for specific projects, go to <span class="guilabel">Manage Projects</span> from the main window, select the project, and then click <span class="guilabel">Project Members</span>. In case of the Desktop Client, this command is available directly from the main window if you activate the projects tree.</p>

            <p>There are two levels of access to projects:</p>
            <div class="variablelist">
              <dl>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Project administrator</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Users with this level of access can manage members and folders of the project. They can also delete or move issues and edit and delete all comments and attachments within the project.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Regular member</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Users with this level of access can view issues in all folders, manage their own alerts, and create new issues and edit existing ones. They can also add comments and attachments, and edit and delete their own comments and attachments.</p>
                </dd>
              </dl>
            </div>
            <p>The global access level is always more important than permissions for a given project. A system administrator automatically becomes the administrator of all projects, and a disabled user has no access to any project. Regular users only have access to projects that they are members of, according to the permissions that were assigned to them.</p>
            <p>To add members of the project, select <span class="guilabel">Add Members</span>.</p>
